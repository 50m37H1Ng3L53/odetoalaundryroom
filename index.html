    <p style="font-weight: 800;">this is an ode to the first place where i felt safe and warm during my refuge</p>
    <br>
    <p>my dear friend was kind to me to offer a place to stay when i planned to visit for 10 days to see my pals. a
        laundry room at the place they were renting.
        the war started 3 weeks before my flight to amsterdam. in march then, after 2 weeks on the road, a short term
        stay little laundry room turned into a place a called home for a year and a half. to be specific - 527 days
    </p>
    <br>
    <div class="alignleft">
        <p>this laundry room have gone thru so much with me<br>
            i did so much there <br>
            i cried myself to sleep there so many nights <br>
            had so many nightmares <br>
            i smoked so many cigs on the balcony of this laundry room <br>
            i had flu of some sort probably 10 times there <br>
            i finished uni, wrote my thesis <br>
            had so many nice moments, sleepovers, little dinners <br>
            i really loved this place, i think it loved me back <br>
            <br>

            this page is a digital ode to this place. this is also it's archive <br>
            i never said a proper goodbye and will forever regret about it <br>
            the last day of moving out and cleaning i did not at all realised it was the last time id see this place
            <br>
            this here will never suffice, but it is at least something to bring me some sort of peace
            about the fact that i never said goodbye <br>
            <br>
            in summer my friend who was hosting me in that room got to know the place is being sold and she needs to
            get out.
            and so do i. <br>
            noone knows whats gonna happen to this place - rennovation of what kind and scale. <br>
            i do not know if my laundry room will be there at all. <br>
            what will they do to it? remove the shelves? connect it to the other little storage space next to it?
            connect it
            to the room next to it? connect all of it together? or just paint the walls? or do nothing? <br>
            with this page i want this room to be remembered as a place that brought at least a bit of peace,
            comfort and safety to someone. as a home rather than just a laundry room. <br>
        </p>
